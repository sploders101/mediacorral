 * 1. Analysis can happen on a more powerful computer, or even more than one.
 * 2. Thread pools like Rayon can function better when there aren't multiple processes.
 * 3. Media analysis isn't changed as often, so this can live in a more permanent location
 *    while other components are being developed.
